## About

Hands of Destruction is a networked **multiplayer PvP** game. The player can control a character that **uses magic** to fight the other players. The player can select from two types of magic - Fire and Ice and three types of armor sets - Thief's, Barbarian's and Arcanist's. These enable **various play styles**. 

There are two game modes available:
 - Destruction Derby - a **team deathmatch** set up in a valley surrounded by mountains;
 - Master Exploder - a classic type of **deathmatch** in western-like red canyon.

To win the game, you have to complete the **objective** under the **time limit** or hold the **highest score** to the end of the game.

As of 2022 and later, the **lobby browser** is unavailable due to the UNet P2P Relay & MM Services discontinuation and the only option to play the game is **direct connection** through LAN networking.
